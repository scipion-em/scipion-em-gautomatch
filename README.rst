Installation
------------

You will need to use `2.0 <https://github.com/I2PC/scipion/releases/tag/V2.0.0>`_ version of Scipion to be able to run these protocols. To install the plugin, you have two options:

a) Stable version
   
   .. code-block::
   
      scipion installp -p scipion-em-gautomatch

b) Developer's version

   * download repository 
   
   .. code-block::
   
      git clone https://github.com/scipion-em/scipion-em-gautomatch.git

   * install 

   .. code-block::
   
      scipion installp -p path_to_scipion-em-gautomatch --devel

Gautomatch binaries will be installed automatically with the plugin, but you can also link an existing installation. 
Default installation path assumed is ``software/em/gautomatch-0.56``, if you want to change it, set *GAUTOMATCH_HOME* in ``scipion.conf`` file to the folder where the Gautomatch is installed. Depending on your CUDA version and GPU card compute capability you might want to change the default binary from ``Gautomatch_v0.56_sm60_cu8.0`` to a different one by explicitly setting *GAUTOMATCH* variable. If you need to use CUDA different from the one used during Scipion installation (defined by CUDA_LIB), you can add *GAUTOMATCH_CUDA_LIB* variable to the config file. Various binaries can be downloaded from the official Gautomatch website. 

To check the installation, simply run the following Scipion test:
``scipion test gautomatch.tests.test_protocols_gautomatch.TestGautomatchAutomaticPicking``
